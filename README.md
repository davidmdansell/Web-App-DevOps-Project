## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.

- **Version Control:** The project is managed using Git, and the codebase is hosted on GitHub.

- **Containerization:** The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.

The dockerfile is as follows:

```dockerfile#
# Step 1 - Use an official Python runtime as a parent image. You can use `python:3.8-slim`.
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:3.9.10-slim-buster
# Step 2 - Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
# Step 3 Copy the application files in the container
COPY . .
# Install system dependencies and ODBC driver
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    unixodbc unixodbc-dev odbcinst odbcinst1debian2 libpq-dev gcc && \

    apt-get purge -y --auto-remove wget && \  
    apt-get clean

# Install pip and setuptools
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# Step 4 - Install Python packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt 

# Step 5 - Expose port 5000, app is accessible from the host machine
EXPOSE 5000

# TODO: Step 6 - Define Startup Command
CMD ["python", "./app.py"]


- **DevOps:** The project is managed using GitHub, and the CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions.
